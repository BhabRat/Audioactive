# Audioactive
Offline audiobook-cum-music player. It basically uses the .m4b or .mp3 files and shows them in a very spotify and audible fashion. It's very sleek. It uses electronjs as a base. 

To use this, please install the electron dependencies. It supports windows, macos. and linux. It works best on linux.

Step by step how-to for linux(it should be similar for every other system):
1) First "cd" into the directory where you have saved the files.
2) Type ```npm install``` and it'll install all the dependencies in the same file.
3) It should create a new "node modules" directory in the said one.
4) Next, create a new directory called "assets" and then keep all your audiofiles (m4b or mp3) inside it. You can make subfolders too!
5) Next, open terminal and type ```npm start``` to start the program.
6) Now you should see the GUI of the program.
7) You are done! Now enjoy!
